<!-- # Biography -->

I’m a PhD student at Tilburg University’s Social Psychology department and the Tilburg Institute for Behavioral Economics Research. With Marcel Zeelenberg and Seger Breugelmans, I study how poverty influences decision making. I’m also an improvisation actor and trainer at the [Tilburg Tigers](http://www.tilburgtigers.nl).
