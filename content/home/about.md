<!-- # Biography -->

I'm a data scientist at the [ETZ hospital](https://www.etz.nl/) in Tilburg. With predictive modeling I try to improve the quality and efficiency of health care.

Previously, I was a behavioral scientist at the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets ([AFM](https://www.afm.nl/)). My [PhD project](publication/dissertation) focused on the influence of poverty on financial decisions.
