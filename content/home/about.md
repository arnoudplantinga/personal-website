<!-- # Biography -->

I'm a behavioral scientist at the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets ([AFM](https://www.afm.nl/)). In the Consumer Behavior team, we apply existing knowledge and perform new studies related to consumer decision making.

My [PhD project](publication/dissertation) focused on the influence of poverty on financial decisions. In this project I worked with Marcel Zeelenberg and Seger Breugelmans.
