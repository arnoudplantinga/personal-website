<!-- # Biography -->

I'm a behavioral scientist at the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets ([AFM](https://www.afm.nl/)). In the Consumer Behavior team, we apply existing knowledge and perform new studies related to consumer decision making.

My PhD project focused on the influence of experiencing poverty on financial decisions. In this project I worked with Marcel Zeelenberg and Seger Breugelmans.
