abstract = "Pepper & Nettle describe possible processes underlying what they call a behavioral constellation of deprivation (BCD). Although we are certain about the application of evolutionary models to our understanding of poverty, we are less certain about the utility of behavioral constellations. The empirical record on poverty-related behaviors is much more divergent and broad than such constellations suggest."

abstract_short = "Opposed to the article we comment on, we do not believe there is one theory that can explain all behavioral effects of poverty."
